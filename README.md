# Pat-Track 
We're introducing Pat-track, a website that allows clinicians to dynamically store patient information, including disease information, medication recommendations, and the dates that patients were diagnosed. The doctor can update the information on the website at any moment following the diagnostic day. The patient can also receive the information from the doctor.
