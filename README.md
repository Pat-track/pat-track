## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up the Pat-Track system locally for development and testing purposes.
### Deployment

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Pat-track/pat-track.git 
```


2. Change into the project directory:  
```bash
 cd pat-track
```

3. Create a local folder:

Create a new folder on your local machine where you want to store the project files.
Move the contents of the cloned repository into this new folder.

Depending on the project setup, you may need to build the project before running it.

If you're using a code editor like Visual Studio Code, you can install a live server extension to simplify running the project.
Install a live server extension of your choice from the editor's extension marketplace.
Once installed, open the project folder in your code editor and look for the option to start a live server.
Click on the option, and the project will automatically open in your browser.
By following these steps, you should be able to clone the repository, create a local folder, and run the project either on localhost or using a live server extension.
   
The Pat-Track project has been deployed using GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://pat-track.github.io/pat-track/).

**Note: Please be aware that GitHub Pages only supports static websites, and certain dynamic functionalities of Pat-Track may not work in this environment.**
